<p> <center> (Legged Robots EPFL, Fall 2018)</center>  </p>
<p> Modeling, simulating , and controlling a three link 2D Biped Robot using MATLAB.</p>

## Running the code
* To run the code open the main.m file.</p>

* Specifiy your speed in the variable desired_speed and run it.</p>

## Parameters of the simulation that can be changed
* You can change the speed of the animation in the file animate.m by changing the value skip.</p>

* You can change the perturbation in the file ext_perturbation_parameters.</p>

* You can change the number of steps in the main file too.</p>
